Phez, the App
=============

*Phez* is a Ruby on Rails application similar to reddit, but with Bitcoin.

It formerly powered the site phez.co, which has since been shuttered.

If you would like to take over maintenance of this project, fork the repo and announce that you are the new maintainer via the usual channels. Thanks! - p4x


Contributing
------------

Contributions are encouraged and desired.

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Add some tests if your changes are code-related (not design). Currently we don't have any (yet). But the more the better, especially unit tests. Ideally we'll get Factory Girl setup in lieu of fixtures.

3. Push your fork and submit a pull request.

Syntax:

* Two spaces, no tabs.
* No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.
* Look through the code and try to use the same style/syntax that's already in place.
